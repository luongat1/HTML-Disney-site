</h2>

<br>
<p>
This is From magic kingdom at walt disney world. It was opened on September 15th, 2015 and it’s still operating today for halloween especially if you’re a “hocus pocus, the nightmare before christmas” fans. The show is 22 minutes long, and in my book and it is all worth it. You can see it at walt disney world during mickey’s not so scary halloween party. The show contains songs including “come little children” and “I put a spell on you” for the finale. The whole show contains 10 villains and you will get to see the sanderson sisters for the first time on stage. The story synopsis shows that the sanderson sisters wanted to throw the biggest halloween/villain party that the fans had ever seen.

  2) Villans Night Out

    This show is from Hong Kong disneyland. It is worth it for the halloween experience at Hong Kong. The show opened on September 13, 2016 and it features synopsis for every story; but every time maleficent comes in and claims the story as her own. While on stage she summons up big time villains from snow white to tangled. This is a show that is totally worth it, although it is performed in mandarin. Regardless, were still able to understand the story. And it is on a 3rd chapter plus it has had minor changes over 2 years; which is to be expected for the 4th chapter in 2019

  This mini parade is from shanghai disneyland that is worthy of your attention. At first there wasn’t going to be halloween parade in shanghai, but we were proved wrong when this was announced and we were delighted when we loved the show. It is a shame there were only 4 floats. Personally I wish we could’ve seen more like for example: lady tremaine, big bad wolf, frollo, oogie boogie and cruella float. This is semi worth it but we think perfect for the mini parade.

<h2> 4) Frightfully Fun Parade  </h2>
<center><img src=https://livingmividaloca.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/disney-villains-frightfully-fun-parade.jpg alt=https://livingmividaloca.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/disney-villains-frightfully-fun-parade.jpg></center>
<br>
<p> This parade is definitely one not to miss. This float is 8 feet long and it is the first time that the villains float appeared in disneyland. This float features many villains including frollo, jafar, evil queen, cruella and hades. It has been 2 years since the parade was first performed, and its still mixing villains in here and there. I would say it is pretty worth it when you see the parade, and this attraction is from disneyland. Most of the villains were incredible in the float. But one was replaced by another a character and that is vampirina hauntley from the popular tv show, “Vampirina”  and it is the best that they put in the villain float as a surprise to guest.<p>

  <h2>5) Happily ever after  </h2>
  <center><img src=http://disneyspringshotels.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Happily-Ever-After.jpg alt= HappilyEverAfter></center>
  <br>
  <p>The show is bound to be one of the best moments of your lifetime. The show opened on may 14th, 2017. It also has a little bit of villain magic in the show, hence why its on this list. The show depicts many of our favorite disney characters Including scenes from the incredibles, little mermaid, mulan, lion king, aladdin and sleeping beauty. The villain segment of the show is absolutely cool and fun. This firework show is at walt disney world

<h2>6) Sorcerer of the magic kingdom  </h2>
<center><img src=https://blog-cdn.touringplans.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SOTMK-poster-221x300.jpg alt=Sorcerer></center>
<br>

<p>The magic games features tons of villains where you can battle the villains from taking over the magic kingdom. It is pretty epic when you battle the villains but you try to succeed to get rid of the villains. Its very interesting indeed. The performance includes villains like governor ratcliffe, dr facilier, scar ursula and so many more.

<br>
<p>
This show is at disneyland, Tokyo disney-sea and disney world. It contains tons of villains to defeat mickey in many different ways, but of course you can not beat the mouse with his own magic! Villains in this feature evil queen, ursula chernabog and maleficent only at disneyland and disney-sea. Disney world ‘s version has more villains including cruella, scar, frollo, jafar and hades plus the villains from disneyland.

<br>
<p>It’s good to be bad with the disney villains is a wonderful show that is incredibly good, and im sure that you’ll want to see it yourself. This show is from Disneyland, Paris  if you are going to europe this is one place you have to be in for halloween. Just like number 2 this is disneyland paris’s version of mix and mingle but it is done a lot of differently there’s a lot of villains in the show. A lot of changes through since it opened in 2015 and it is coming back in 2018 for the halloween season.  Spoiler alert: donald duck  is in the show this year.

<h1> Honorable Mentions
</h1>
<p> Before we get into the number 10 spot, lets look at some other great disney villan attractions that came just short of making the list
  <h2> Villan Mix and Mingle
  </h2>
  <center><img src= https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/2/2d/2939867741_0fbee89958.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/516?cb=20161002130038 alt=MixMingle ></center>
  <br>
  <p>Villain mix and mingle is a former show at walt disney world opened at 2005 and ended in 2014 it was on number 2, but it is has to be in honorable mentions. The songs were incredible for the party. Villains include jafar, maleficent, hook, queen of hearts, frollo and so much more.  We were sad to see it go, but we got hocus pocus villain spelltacular instead and we loved it to our hearts contend.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Villans Unleashed
  </h2>
  <center><img src=https://i2.wp.com/chipandco.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Villains-Unleashed.jpg?resize=425%2C500&ssl=1  alt=VillansUnleashed ></center>
  <br>
  <p>Villains unleashed is a former event that has villain entertainment including villainy in the sky and it only happen in 2013 and 2014.  It has a opening ceremony that contains all the villains that were invited like for example, bowler hat guy, oogie boogie, dr facilier, gantu and dr hamsterviel, and so much more. You would meet the villains as the night goes by. And it features oogie boogie’s freaky funhouse show which it was awesome. It contains performing arts that swallows sword which none of us do and a dart love arrow segment which is scary but luckily they didn’t get killed for the event. And at the end of the night you will get villainy in the sky which is the villain memories of fireworks that you won’t forget. The event is worth it actually totally worth it.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Hallowishes
  </h2>
  <center><img src=https://secure.parksandresorts.wdpromedia.com/media/disneyparks/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/HHWG58068.jpg=20110807105602  alt=Hallowishes ></center>
  <br>
  <p>Hallowishes is a firework show and it happens every year at walt disney world. This show was incredible and good journey. It features song includes grim grinning ghosts, this is halloween, be prepared and poor unfortunate souls. I love the fireworks so that we can celebrate halloween. This show opened in 2005 and it is still going on today. In 2008 they edited the maleficent and frollo’s song cutout along a little bit of scaryoke. That was awesome but sad to see it go. The show is semi worth it if you don’t listen to it a lot.
  </p>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Villans World
  </h2>
  <center><img src=https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/2/2b/The_Villains_World_Tokyo_2016.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/516?cb=20160919022743 alt=VillansWorld ></center>
  <br>
  <p>Villains world is a show on tokyo disneysea.  The show has it’s own theme song which i liked. And it features my favorite villains jafar, maleficent, hades, captain hook, evil queen and ursula. This is worth it at tokyo disneysea for halloween. This show was opened in september 9th 2015 and it still going around today for halloween. The show is water floats and stage only to the show content.

  <br>
  <p>This parade is a must see at disney world during the halloween party this parade features many villains from 2005 through now. There is a song that goes with the parade that you will be singing through lifetime called it’s good to be bad also known villains a go go unit.  Many villains have appeared including frollo, big bad wolf, stromboli, sheriff of nottingham, honest john and etc This is a total worth it a 10/10.  If you are going to mickey’s not so scary halloween party of any year this is one parade if you can’t miss. This parade is going strong every year. Most are very independent enough to be apart of the parade.
