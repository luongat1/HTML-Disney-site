  <h1> About The Author</h1>
  <p>My name is grant i am 18 years old. I am autistic and Here is the reason why i created the list. Ever since i liked disney villains almost a decade ago i had no idea that there will be more attractions like this. I had many sources like the disney wiki, that is my true nature of using that wiki daily. We had a disney villains wiki for 10 years and massive changes over 2 years  now. Plus the disney villains are true passion and the things that i like them is creative, support and being there for them every day. Another reason is everybody is doing top 10 like watchmojo and honorable mentions was use all the time in our wiki and everyday lives. You can believe in yourself and do anything in your life that you wanna  do. </p>
